                <p>God’s Kingdom is a real government established by Jehovah God, with Jesus Christ as King. It will rule over the earth, bringing peace and righteousness, fulfilling the prayer Jesus taught us to pray.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Matthew 6:9-10 - “You must pray, then, this way: ‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth.’”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Daniel 2:44 - “In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed... It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it alone will stand forever.”</p>

                <p>God’s Kingdom is based in heaven, where Jesus rules as King alongside 144,000 chosen ones. However, its rule will extend over the earth, transforming it into a paradise.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 11:15 - “The seventh angel blew his trumpet. And there were loud voices in heaven, saying: ‘The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king forever and ever.’”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 5:10 - “And you made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God, and they are to rule as kings over the earth.”</p>

                <summary>3. When will God’s Kingdom come?</summary>
                <p>God’s Kingdom has already begun ruling in heaven since 1914, as shown by Bible prophecy and world events. Its full effects on earth will come soon, when it destroys human governments and establishes paradise.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Matthew 24:14 - “And this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 12:10 - “Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the Kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down.”</p>

                <summary>4. Who will rule in God’s Kingdom?</summary>
                <p>Jesus Christ is the King of God’s Kingdom, appointed by Jehovah. He will rule with 144,000 faithful ones chosen from earth to serve as kings and priests in heaven.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Isaiah 9:6-7 - “For a child has been born to us, a son has been given to us; and the government will rest on his shoulder... The zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 14:1 - “Then I saw, and look! the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who have his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.”</p>

                <summary>5. What will God’s Kingdom do for the earth?</summary>
                <p>God’s Kingdom will remove all suffering, sickness, and death, transforming the earth into a paradise where righteousness prevails. It will fulfill God’s original purpose for humanity.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 21:3-4 - “Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them... Death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Psalm 72:7 - “In his days the righteous will flourish, and peace will abound until the moon is no more.”</p>

                <summary>6. How is God’s Kingdom different from human governments?</summary>
                <p>Unlike human governments, which are temporary and often unjust, God’s Kingdom is eternal, ruled by a perfect King—Jesus—and guided by God’s laws. It won’t be corrupted or fail.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Daniel 2:44 - “In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed... It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it alone will stand forever.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 18:36 - “Jesus answered: ‘My Kingdom is no part of this world. If my Kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought... But as it is, my Kingdom is not from this source.’”</p>

            <details>
                <summary>7. Why do you preach about the Kingdom?</summary>
                <p>We preach about the Kingdom because Jesus commanded his followers to share this good news worldwide. It’s the hope for all mankind, and telling others honors God and helps them gain life.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Matthew 28:19-20 - “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations... teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Luke 4:43 - “But he said to them: ‘I must also declare the good news of the Kingdom of God to other cities, because for this I was sent.’”</p>

            <details>
                <summary>8. Can anyone benefit from God’s Kingdom?</summary>
                <p>Yes, anyone who exercises faith in Jesus and obeys God can benefit from the Kingdom, either by living on a paradise earth or, for the 144,000, ruling in heaven. It’s open to all who respond.</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 3:16 - “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Acts 10:34-35 - “At this Peter began to speak, and he said: ‘Now I truly understand that God is not partial, but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.’”</p>

            <details>
                <summary>9. How do we know God’s Kingdom is real?</summary>
                <p>We know it’s real because the Bible foretold signs of its presence—like wars, famines, and the preaching of the good news—which we see today. These prove the Kingdom is ruling in heaven now.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Matthew 24:7, 14 - “For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another... And this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">2 Timothy 3:1-5 - “But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money...”</p>

                <summary>10. How can I learn more about the Kingdom?</summary>
                <p>You can learn more by studying the Bible with us! It reveals everything about the Kingdom—its ruler, its purpose, and how it affects you. We’d love to show you what it says.</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 17:3 - “This means everlasting life, their coming to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Psalm 119:105 - “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light for my path.”</p>
