                <p>The resurrection is God’s promise to bring the dead back to life, restoring them with their unique identity, personality, and memories. It’s a real hope for billions who have died, offering them a chance to live again.</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 5:28-29 - “Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Acts 24:15 - “There is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.”</p>

                <p>Both the righteous—those who obeyed God—and the unrighteous—those who didn’t know Him—will be resurrected. However, those judged as irreformably wicked will not return to life.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Acts 24:15 - “I have hope toward God... that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Matthew 23:33 - “Serpents, offspring of vipers, how will you flee from the judgment of Gehenna?”</p>

                <p>Most will be resurrected to life on a paradise earth, while a limited group of 144,000 will be resurrected to heaven to rule with Christ as kings and priests.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Psalm 37:29 - “The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 14:1, 3 - “The Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000... who have been bought from the earth.”</p>

                <p>The resurrection to heaven began during Christ’s presence, which started in 1914. The resurrection to earth will occur during Christ’s Thousand-Year Reign, transforming the earth into a paradise.</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 Corinthians 15:23 - “Each one in his own proper order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who belong to the Christ during his presence.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 20:6 - “They will be priests of God and of the Christ, and they will rule as kings with him for the thousand years.”</p>

                <summary>5. How does God perform the resurrection?</summary>
                <p>Jehovah grants Jesus the power to raise the dead, using His perfect memory to recreate each person as they were, either with a spirit body for heaven or a physical body for earth.</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 11:25 - “Jesus said to her: ‘I am the resurrection and the life.’”</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 Corinthians 15:44 - “It is sown a physical body; it is raised up a spiritual body.”</p>

                <summary>6. Why is the resurrection reasonable?</summary>
                <p>The resurrection is reasonable because God has already demonstrated His power through nine recorded resurrections in the Bible, each witnessed by many, and He yearns to bring the dead back.</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 11:43-44 - “He cried out with a loud voice: ‘Lazarus, come out!’ The man who had been dead came out.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Job 14:15 - “You will call, and I will answer you. You will long for the work of your hands.”</p>

                <summary>7. What happens to the soul at death?</summary>
                <p>The Bible teaches that the soul is the person, not a separate entity that survives death. At death, a person ceases to exist until resurrected, not reuniting with a soul but being recreated.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Ezekiel 18:4 - “The soul who sins is the one who will die.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Ecclesiastes 9:5 - “The dead know nothing at all.”</p>

                <summary>8. Will the resurrected face judgment?</summary>
                <p>Yes, those resurrected to earth will face a judgment period during the Thousand-Year Reign, where their actions will determine if they gain everlasting life or face destruction.</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 5:29 - “Those who did good things to a resurrection of life, and those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 20:12 - “The dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.”</p>

                <summary>9. How does Jesus’ resurrection give us hope?</summary>
                <p>Jesus’ resurrection proves God’s power over death and guarantees that others will follow. As the “firstfruits,” it confirms the promise of life for all who exercise faith in him.</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 Corinthians 15:20 - “Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep in death.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Acts 17:31 - “He has set a day when he will judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed.”</p>

                <p>You can deepen your understanding by studying the Bible with us! It offers detailed accounts and promises about the resurrection, giving hope for you and your loved ones.</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 17:3 - “This means everlasting life, their coming to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Romans 15:4 - “All the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.”</p>
