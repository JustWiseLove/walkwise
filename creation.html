                <p class="scripture">Isaiah 45:18 - “For this is what Jehovah says, the Creator of the heavens... the One who formed the earth... He did not create it simply for nothing, but he formed it to be inhabited.”</p>

                <p>Yes, Jesus, as God’s “firstborn,” was the agent through whom Jehovah created all other things, working as the “master worker” alongside his Father.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Colossians 1:16 - “By means of him all other things were created in the heavens and on the earth.”</p>

                <p>Creation displays God’s power through its vastness—like the stars—and its complexity—like the human body—proving He is the Almighty with limitless ability.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Psalm 19:1 - “The heavens are declaring the glory of God; the skies above proclaim the work of his hands.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Romans 1:20 - “His invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship.”</p>

                <summary>6. Are the creative days 24 hours long?</summary>
                <p>No, the Bible’s “days” of creation refer to long periods of time, not literal 24-hour days, allowing for a gradual preparation of the earth over ages.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Genesis 2:4 - “This is a history of the heavens and the earth in the time they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">2 Peter 3:8 - “One day is with Jehovah as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.”</p>

                <summary>7. How does creation differ from evolution?</summary>
                <p>Creation is an intentional act by Jehovah, giving life purpose and order, while evolution suggests random chance, which the Bible does not support.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Genesis 1:21 - “So God created the great sea creatures... and every winged flying creature according to its kind.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Hebrews 3:4 - “Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things is God.”</p>

                <summary>8. What does creation teach us about Jehovah?</summary>
                <p>Creation reveals Jehovah’s love, wisdom, and generosity, as He made a beautiful earth for humans to enjoy and provided everything needed for life.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Psalm 104:24 - “How many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth is full of what you have made.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Acts 14:17 - “He did not leave himself without witness, for he did good, giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons.”</p>

        <div class="card">
            <details>
                <summary>9. Why should we care for God’s creation?</summary>
                <p>We should care for creation because Jehovah entrusted the earth to humans to manage responsibly, and doing so honors Him and preserves it for future generations.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Genesis 2:15 - “Jehovah God took the man and settled him in the garden of Eden to cultivate it and to take care of it.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 11:18 - “But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came... to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.”</p>

                <summary>10. How can I learn more about creation?</summary>
                <p>You can learn more by studying the Bible with us! It explains the wonders of creation and how they point to Jehovah’s purpose for you and the earth.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Job 12:7-9 - “Ask the beasts, and they will teach you; the birds of the heavens... Who among all these does not know that the hand of Jehovah has done this?”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Psalm 119:105 - “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light for my path.”</p>
