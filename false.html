                    <tr><th>Truth</th><td>Jehovah’s Witnesses teach that true worship avoids pagan customs. The Bible gives no date for Jesus’ birth, and early Christians did not celebrate it.</td></tr>
                    <tr><th>False</th><td>Christmas, observed by nearly all Christians on December 25, is a direct descendant of the Roman Saturnalia, a debauched festival honoring the god Saturn with feasting, gift-giving, and evergreen decorations—customs mirrored in modern celebrations. This date also aligns with the birthday of Mithra, the Persian sun god, celebrated across the Roman Empire. Historical records show that Jesus could not have been born in winter, as Luke 2:8 notes shepherds “living out of doors” with their flocks, impossible in Judea’s cold, rainy season. The celebration was officially adopted in 336 C.E. under Emperor Constantine, who blended pagan rituals with Christianity to unify his empire, a clear departure from the Bible’s silence on such a holiday. This fusion of paganism persists in Christendom’s trees, wreaths, and focus on materialism, none of which honor Jehovah.</td></tr>

                    <tr><th>False</th><td>Easter, celebrated by most Christians, is steeped in pagan fertility worship, tracing back to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, whose name survives in the holiday’s title. Ancient rites for Ishtar and her Germanic counterpart, Eostre, involved eggs and rabbits—symbols of reproduction—still central to Easter today. These customs predate Christianity by centuries, evident in Babylonian reliefs and Anglo-Saxon festivals marking spring’s renewal. By the 4th century C.E., the church, under Roman influence, merged these pagan traditions with Jesus’ resurrection, despite no scriptural mandate for such a celebration. Acts 12:4’s mistranslation as “Easter” in some Bibles (instead of “Passover”) reflects this later corruption. The focus on bunnies and egg hunts glorifies creation, not Jehovah, contradicting pure worship.</td></tr>

It mirrors pagan triads like Egypt’s Osiris-Isis-Horus and Babylon’s Sin-Nanna-Ishtar, where three deities formed a unified godhead—concepts well-known in the Greco-Roman world. Greek philosophers like Plato, with his triadic metaphysics, further shaped this doctrine, which was alien to Jesus and his apostles. The Bible never uses “Trinity”; instead, 1 John 5:7’s added clause (“the Father, the Word, and the holy spirit”)—absent from early manuscripts—was inserted centuries later to bolster this idea. John 14:28 (“the Father is greater than I”) and Acts 2:32 show Jesus as distinct and subordinate, exposing the Trinity as a pagan-inspired falsehood.</td></tr>

Archaeological finds, like the ankh in Egypt and Tau cross in Mesopotamia, confirm its pre-Christian use in worship of gods like Tammuz. The Greek word “stauros” means an upright stake, not a two-beamed cross, yet Constantine’s vision in 312 C.E.—claiming a cross-shaped sign—cemented its adoption in 4th-century Christendom, turning a torture device into an idol. Early Christians avoided such symbols, and Exodus 20:4 forbids images in worship. Today’s crosses on churches and necklaces reflect this pagan legacy, not biblical truth, making it a tool of false devotion.</td></tr>

These customs, steeped in astrology and superstition, are reflected in candles (originally lit to ward off spirits) and wishes (prayers to pagan deities). The Bible’s only birthday accounts—Pharaoh’s (killing a baker) and Herod’s (beheading John)—link them to pagans, not Jehovah’s servants. Early Christians, living among these cultures, rejected such festivities as worldly. Christendom’s embrace of birthdays, with no scriptural basis, perpetuates this pagan tradition, diverting honor from Jehovah to individuals.</td></tr>

This idea infiltrated Judaism via Hellenism and entered Christianity by the 2nd century C.E., championed by thinkers like Origen and Augustine. Pagan cultures—Egypt with its ka, Babylon with its afterlife journeys—also held this belief, clashing with Genesis 2:7, where man “became a living soul” (not received one). Ezekiel 18:4 (“the soul who sins will die”) confirms mortality, yet Christendom’s immortal soul underpins false hopes of heaven or hell, denying the resurrection promised in John 5:28-29.</td></tr>

This concept entered Christianity via apocryphal writings by the 2nd century C.E. and was solidified by Dante’s “Inferno” (14th century), amplifying earlier distortions. The Bible’s “Gehenna” (Mark 9:47-48) was a literal garbage dump where fire consumed, not tortured—a symbol of destruction, not eternal pain. Revelation 20:14 shows “death and the Grave” cast into the lake of fire, meaning annihilation. Christendom’s hellfire contradicts Jehovah’s justice (Romans 6:23: “the wages of sin is death”), adopting pagan terror instead of truth.</td></tr>

By the 4th century C.E., Christianity, under Roman influence, repurposed these idols into saints and Mary, defying the second commandment. Historical records show early Christians avoided such objects, yet councils like Nicaea II (787 C.E.) justified their veneration, claiming they aided devotion—an excuse rooted in paganism. Today’s altars and stained-glass saints echo this idolatry, turning worshippers’ focus from Jehovah to man-made creations, a clear violation of biblical purity.</td></tr>

                    <tr><th>False</th><td>Praying to saints, widespread in Catholicism and Orthodoxy, mirrors pagan polytheism, where Greeks invoked Hermes or Athena, and Romans sought intercession from lesser deities. This practice emerged in the 3rd century C.E., as Christians began honoring martyrs, evolving into formal canonization by the 10th century. The Bible never depicts praying to humans; instead, Jesus taught direct prayer to God (Matthew 6:9). The elevation of saints—complete with feast days and patronages—parallels Babylon’s pantheon, diluting Jehovah’s exclusive worship.

The Bible limits heaven to 144,000 (Revelation 14:1), while Matthew 5:5 promises the meek “will inherit the earth.” Early Christians expected an earthly paradise, but by blending Greek philosophy with Christianity, the church shifted focus skyward, ignoring Jehovah’s purpose to restore Eden (Genesis 1:28).

Ancient myths depict these goddesses as queens of heaven, a role Mary assumed in Christian art and prayer by the Middle Ages. The Bible never exalts her; Acts 1:14 shows her as a humble disciple, not a mediator. Rosaries, icons, and Marian feasts, rooted in pagan adoration of divine mothers, elevate her above her scriptural role, turning worship from Jehovah to a human figure.</td></tr>

By the 20th century, denominations began justifying it, claiming moral ambiguity, yet Genesis 9:6 (“Whoever sheds man’s blood, by man his blood will be shed”) applies to the unborn.

Pagan Rome’s warlike ethos fused with the church, seen in “just war” theories by Augustine (5th century C.E.) and blessings of armies by clergy. Jesus rejected violence (Matthew 26:52: “All those who take up the sword will perish by the sword”) and political power (John 18:36), yet Christendom’s flags, anthems, and battle hymns mirror Babylon’s nationalism.

                <table>
                    <tr><th>Truth</th><td>Jehovah forbids spiritism (Galatians 5:20: “spiritism” as a work of the flesh).</td></tr>
                    <tr><th>False</th><td>Practices like All Souls’ Day, common in some churches, mimic pagan spiritism, where Babylonians and Celts honored the dead with offerings, believing spirits influenced the living. By the 10th century C.E., the church sanctioned this as a Christian rite, despite Leviticus 19:31 banning such acts. Prayers for the dead and veneration of relics echo Egypt’s cult of Osiris, blending occultism with faith. This defiance of Jehovah’s command opens doors to demonic influence (1 Corinthians 10:20), corrupting true worship.</td></tr>

        <summary>19. Homosexuality</summary>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Truth</th><td>Jehovah designed sexual relations for marriage between a man and a woman, reflecting His purpose for human creation (Genesis 1:27-28: “Male and female he created them”). Homosexual acts violate this standard, but God offers forgiveness and change through Christ (1 Corinthians 6:9-11: “That is what some of you were. But you have been washed clean”).</td></tr>
            <tr><th>False</th><td>Pagan cultures, like ancient Greece and Rome, normalized homosexuality, with Greek pederasty and Roman excesses influencing modern acceptance. Canaanite fertility cults also embraced such acts, condemned in Leviticus 18:22 (“Detestable act”). Christendom’s recent liberal shift—claiming love justifies all—echoes these ancient practices, defying Romans 1:26-27 (“Vile affections… receiving the full penalty”). This rejection of Jehovah’s design distorts His moral law and the hope of transformation.</td></tr>

                    <tr><th>Truth</th><td>Humans live once, then face resurrection (Hebrews 9:27: “Judgment” after death).</td></tr>
                    <tr><th>False</th><td>Some liberal teachings hint at karma or reincarnation, concepts from Hinduism and Buddhism where actions cycle through lives, entering Western thought via 19th-century philosophers like Schopenhauer. Pagan Egypt’s rebirth myths and Greek Orphism also shaped this idea, clashing with Ecclesiastes 9:10 (“No work nor planning… in the Grave”). Christendom’s flirtation with “what goes around comes around” as divine justice mimics these cycles, rejecting the Bible’s one-life hope (John 5:28-29). This subtle paganism distorts Jehovah’s plan.</td></tr>
