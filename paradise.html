                <summary>1. What is Paradise according to the Bible?</summary>
                <p>Paradise is the future condition of the earth when it’s restored to the perfect state God originally intended, a place of peace, happiness, and everlasting life. Jesus promised it to the evildoer next to him, showing it’s a real hope for humans.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Luke 23:43 - “And he said to him: ‘Truly I tell you today, you will be with me in Paradise.’”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Psalm 37:29 - “The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.”</p>

                <summary>2. Will everyone live in Paradise?</summary>
                <p>Not everyone will live in Paradise. The Bible says the righteous who exercise faith in God and obey Him will inherit the earth, while the wicked will be removed. It’s a reward for those who love God.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Psalm 37:9-11 - “For evil men will be done away with, but those hoping in Jehovah will possess the earth... The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 3:36 - “The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; the one who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him.”</p>

                <summary>3. What happens when we die—do we go to Paradise right away?</summary>
                <p>When we die, we don’t go to Paradise immediately. The Bible teaches that death is like a sleep—there’s no consciousness until the resurrection. Paradise will be on earth after God restores it, and the dead will be raised to live there.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Ecclesiastes 9:5 - “For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all, nor do they have any more reward, because all memory of them is forgotten.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 11:11, 14 - “After he said these things, he added: ‘Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep, but I am traveling there to awaken him.’ ... Then Jesus said to them plainly: ‘Lazarus has died.’”</p>

                <summary>4. Isn’t Paradise the same as heaven?</summary>
                <p>No, Paradise and heaven are different. Heaven is where God and the angels reside, and where a limited group—144,000—will rule with Christ. Paradise will be the restored earth, where most faithful people will live forever.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 14:1, 3 - “Then I saw, and look! the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000... They are singing what seems to be a new song before the throne... and no one was able to master that song except the 144,000, who have been bought from the earth.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 21:3-4 - “Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them... Death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.”</p>

        <div class="card">
            <details>
                <summary>5. Will people in Paradise ever die again?</summary>
                <p>No, in Paradise, death will be eliminated. The Bible promises that those resurrected to life on earth will live forever, as God’s original purpose for humans—eternal life—will be fulfilled.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 21:4 - “And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Isaiah 25:8 - “He will swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces.”</p>

                <summary>6. What about hellfire—won’t the wicked burn forever instead of going to Paradise?</summary>
                <p>The Bible doesn’t teach a burning hellfire. The wicked will be destroyed, not tormented forever. The word “hell” in the Bible often means the grave, and eternal punishment is eternal death, not conscious suffering.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Ezekiel 18:4 - “The soul who sins is the one who will die.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Romans 6:23 - “For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.”</p>

                <summary>7. Who will rule over the Paradise earth?</summary>
                <p>Jesus Christ and the 144,000 chosen ones will rule over the Paradise earth from heaven. They form God’s Kingdom government, which will bring peace and righteousness to the earth.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Daniel 7:13-14 - “I kept watching in the visions of the night, and look!... To him [the Son of man] there were given rulership, honor, and a kingdom, that the peoples, nations, and languages should all serve him.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 5:10 - “And you made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God, and they are to rule as kings over the earth.”</p>

                <summary>8. What will life be like in Paradise?</summary>
                <p>Life in Paradise will be peaceful and joyful, with no sickness, war, or death. People will live in harmony with each other and nature, fulfilling God’s original purpose for the earth.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Isaiah 11:6-9 - “The wolf will reside for a while with the lamb... They will not cause any harm or any ruin in all my holy mountain, because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Isaiah 65:21-22 - “They will build houses and live in them, and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage... For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree.”</p>

                <summary>9. How does believing in Paradise affect us now?</summary>
                <p>Believing in Paradise gives us hope and purpose today. It motivates us to live righteously, share this hope with others, and trust in God’s promises, even in a troubled world.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Titus 1:2 - “This hope is based on a promise of the everlasting life that God, who cannot lie, promised long ago.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Hebrews 11:1 - “Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.”</p>

                <p class="scripture">John 17:3 - “This means everlasting life, their coming to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">2 Timothy 3:16-17 - “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, so that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.”</p>
