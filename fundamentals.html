            <summary>1. Jehovah’s Sovereignty Is Supreme</summary>
            <p>Jehovah’s sovereignty—His absolute right to rule—is the foundation of all truth. In Eden, Satan challenged this by deceiving Eve, asserting that humans could rule independently (Genesis 3:4-5). This rebellion birthed a cosmic issue: Who rules best? Jehovah’s response was not immediate destruction but a patient demonstration of His superior way. History reveals Satan’s failure—wars, tyranny, and misery under human and demonic rule since Cain’s time. Nimrod, a rebel king, built Babel to defy Jehovah (Genesis 11:4), while apostate Israel later tarnished His name through idolatry. Satan, the “ruler of this world” (John 12:31), orchestrates this opposition, but Jehovah’s Kingdom, established in 1914, will crush all rivals, proving His sovereignty forever.</p>
            <p class="scripture">“Jehovah has become King! ... Your throne is established from long ago; you are from everlasting.” — Psalm 93:1-2</p>
            <p class="scripture">“The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice.” — Deuteronomy 32:4</p>
            <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is King forever and ever; the nations have perished from his earth.” — Psalm 10:16</p>

            <summary>2. Sanctifying Jehovah’s Name Is Paramount</summary>
            <p>Jehovah’s name must be sanctified—cleared of all slander—because Satan’s lie in Eden cast it into disrepute, claiming God withheld good (Genesis 3:5). False religion, led by apostate Christianity, erased His name from Scripture, replacing it with “Lord” by the 4th century C.E. under Roman influence. Constantine, a sun-worshipping emperor, blended paganism with Christianity in 325 C.E. at Nicaea, furthering this profanation. The Jewish clergy, by Jesus’ day, banned pronouncing Jehovah’s name, a tradition Jesus rejected (John 17:26). Today, Christendom’s hypocrisy—wars, greed, immorality—defames Him, but Jehovah’s Kingdom will vindicate His name, as Ezekiel foretold.</p>
            <p class="scripture">“You must pray, then, this way: ‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.’” — Matthew 6:9</p>
            <p class="scripture">“I will certainly sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the nations...” — Ezekiel 36:23</p>
            <p class="scripture">“I have made your name known to them and will make it known...” — John 17:26</p>

            <summary>3. The Bible Is God’s Infallible Word</summary>
            <p>The Bible is Jehovah’s unerring Word, written by 40 men under holy spirit’s guidance over 1,600 years. Its purity was attacked after the apostles’ death (1st century C.E.) when apostates like Origen (3rd century) mixed Greek philosophy—Plato’s triads—into Christianity, birthing the Trinity. The Catholic Church, formalized under Constantine in 313 C.E., banned personal Bible reading by the laity, enforcing Latin Vulgate distortions (e.g., 1 John 5:7’s added clause). Jewish scribes added traditions, like the Talmud, diluting truth. Yet, Jehovah preserved His Word—manuscripts like the Dead Sea Scrolls confirm its accuracy—making it the sole authority over human creeds.</p>
            <p class="scripture">“All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight...” — 2 Timothy 3:16-17</p>
            <p class="scripture">“Your word is truth.” — John 17:17</p>
            <p class="scripture">“The word of Jehovah endures forever.” — 1 Peter 1:25</p>

            <summary>4. Satan Rules This World Temporarily</summary>
            <p>Satan, once a perfect angel, rebelled before Eden, becoming the “original serpent” (Revelation 12:9). He usurped world rulership by deceiving Adam and Eve, a claim Jesus acknowledged (John 14:30). Babylon’s king Nimrod (c. 21st century B.C.E.) exemplified Satan’s sway, defying Jehovah with a tower. Rome’s emperors, like Nero (1st century C.E.), and later Constantine, fused paganism into Christianity, cementing Satan’s grip. Today, he blinds minds via false religion, governments, and media (2 Corinthians 4:4), but his rule ends at Armageddon, as Jehovah reclaims earth. The last days began in 1914, fulfilling Daniel’s prophecy (Daniel 4:17) with World War I, famines, and global preaching. Jesus foretold these signs (Matthew 24:7-14), unmatched before. Satan, cast from heaven (Revelation 12:9), intensifies woes, while apostate Christianity denies the end, embracing evolution (19th century, Darwin). Jehovah’s timeline proves we’re near Armageddon.</p>
            <p class="scripture">“The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” — 1 John 5:19</p>
            <p class="scripture">“The great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan...” — Revelation 12:9</p>
            <p class="scripture">“In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here.” — 2 Timothy 3:1</p>
            <p class="scripture">“This good news of the Kingdom will be preached... and then the end will come.” — Matthew 24:14</p>

            <summary>5. Blood Is Sacred and Forbidden</summary>
            <p>Blood is life itself, declared sacred by Jehovah to Noah (Genesis 9:4) and reaffirmed to Christians (Acts 15:29). Pagan nations like Rome drank blood in rituals, but true worshippers abstained. Apostate Christianity, by the Middle Ages, ignored this, with figures like Thomas Aquinas (13th century) justifying worldly practices. The 20th-century medical industry pushed transfusions, defying God’s law, yet Jehovah provides alternatives. Satan promotes this violation to dishonor life’s sanctity, but obedience preserves true worship.</p>
            <p class="scripture">“Only flesh with its life—its blood—you must not eat.” — Genesis 9:4</p>
            <p class="scripture">“To keep abstaining from... blood...” — Acts 15:29</p>
            <p class="scripture">“The life of the flesh is in the blood...” — Leviticus 17:11</p>

            <summary>6. Jesus’ Ransom Redeems Mankind</summary>
            <p>Jesus’ death in 33 C.E. paid Adam’s debt, a perfect life for a perfect life, ending sin’s curse (Romans 5:12). Israel’s sacrifices foreshadowed this, but apostates like Augustine (5th century) twisted it into an immortal soul myth, denying the ransom’s need. Constantine’s church made salvation a clergy privilege, obscuring faith’s role. Satan blinds people to this truth (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s purpose—everlasting life for the obedient—stands firm through Jesus’ blood.</p>
            <p class="scripture">“He gave himself a corresponding ransom for all...” — 1 Timothy 2:6</p>
            <p class="scripture">“Everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” — John 3:16</p>
            <p class="scripture">“Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin...” — Romans 5:12</p>
            <p class="scripture">“The Son of man came... to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.” — Matthew 20:28</p>

            <summary>7. Baptism Marks True Dedication</summary>
            <p>Baptism by immersion, as Jesus modeled in 29 C.E., is a public vow to Jehovah, required for salvation (Mark 1:9-10). The Catholic Church, under Constantine’s successors, introduced infant sprinkling by the 3rd century C.E., a pagan rite from Babylon’s fertility cults. Early Christians baptized only believers—apostates corrupted this with rituals like confirmation. Satan uses these distortions to dilute dedication, but true baptism remains Jehovah’s standard.</p>
            <p class="scripture">“Go, therefore, and make disciples... baptizing them...” — Matthew 28:19</p>
            <p class="scripture">“Rise, get baptized, and wash your sins away...” — Acts 22:16</p>
            <p class="scripture">“Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ...” — Acts 2:38</p>

            <summary>8. Jehovah Judges Righteously</summary>
            <p>Jehovah’s judgment is perfect, weighing deeds and hearts, as shown with Sodom (Genesis 19) and Nineveh (Jonah 3). Satan’s world accuses God of injustice, but history—like the Flood (Genesis 7)—proves His fairness. Apostate Christianity, via Augustine’s predestination (5th century), denied free will, twisting judgment into fate. Jehovah’s final verdict at Armageddon and the Thousand-Year Reign will destroy the wicked and reward the faithful. Armageddon is Jehovah’s war against Satan’s world—false religion falls first (Revelation 17:16), then wicked rulers. Babylon’s fall (587 B.C.E.) prefigured this. Constantine’s church, blending paganism, will be annihilated. Satan rallies nations (Gog of Magog), but Jehovah triumphs, restoring earth.</p>
            <p class="scripture">“He will render to each one according to his works.” — Romans 2:6</p>
            <p class="scripture">“The dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.” — Revelation 20:12</p>
            <p class="scripture">“They gathered them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Armageddon.” — Revelation 16:16</p>

            <summary>9. Marriage Reflects God’s Design</summary>
            <p>Jehovah instituted marriage in Eden (Genesis 2:24), a sacred union of one man and woman. Pagan Babylon introduced polygamy, and Rome’s immorality seeped into Christianity via Constantine’s lax laws (4th century C.E.). The Catholic Church later added celibacy vows, defying God’s purpose. Satan attacks marriage with divorce and perversion, but Jehovah upholds its permanence, allowing separation only for adultery.</p>
            <p class="scripture">“A man will... stick to his wife, and they will become one flesh.” — Genesis 2:24</p>
            <p class="scripture">“Let marriage be honorable among all...” — Hebrews 13:4</p>
            <p class="scripture">“What God has y Yoked together, let no man put apart.” — Matthew 19:6</p>

            <summary>10. Neutrality Preserves True Worship</summary>
            <p>True Christians reject war and politics, as Jesus did (John 18:36). Early believers faced death under Nero (1st century C.E.) rather than fight. Constantine militarized Christianity in 312 C.E. with his cross vision, birthing the Crusades (11th-13th centuries). Satan fuels nationalism, but Jehovah’s people remain neutral, awaiting His Kingdom.</p>
            <p class="scripture">“My Kingdom is no part of this world...” — John 18:36</p>
            <p class="scripture">“They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.” — John 17:16</p>
            <p class="scripture">“Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath...” — Romans 12:19</p>

            <summary>11. Death Is a Sleep Awaiting Resurrection</summary>
            <p>Death is unconsciousness, a sleep until resurrection (John 11:11). Satan’s lie—“You will not die” (Genesis 3:4)—spawned afterlife myths. Egypt’s Osiris cult (c. 2500 B.C.E.) and Plato (4th century B.C.E.) pushed immortal souls, adopted by Origen (3rd century C.E.) into Christianity. The soul is the person, mortal, not immortal (Genesis 2:7). Egypt’s ka (c. 3000 B.C.E.) and Augustine (5th century C.E.) furthered this lie. Hell is the grave (Sheol/Hades), not fiery torment—Babylonian underworld myths (c. 2000 B.C.E.), Greece’s Hades, and Dante (14th century C.E.) via Augustine’s errors twisted this. Jehovah’s truth—dust returns to dust—prevails: death ends life until resurrection, and the wicked face eternal death, not torture.</p>
            <p class="scripture">“The dead know nothing at all...” — Ecclesiastes 9:5</p>
            <p class="scripture">“Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep, but I am traveling there to awaken him.” — John 11:11</p>

Early Christians defied Rome’s bans (Acts 5:42), while the Catholic Church silenced lay preaching by the 4th century C.E., hoarding truth. Satan opposes this work, but it’s the lifeline to salvation before Armageddon.</p>

            <summary>17. The Thousand-Year Reign Restores Earth</summary>
            <p>Christ’s Thousand-Year Reign begins after Armageddon, when Jesus and the 144,000 rule from heaven, restoring earth to paradise. Satan, bound in the aftermath of 1914’s Kingdom birth (Revelation 20:2-3), is abyssed, unable to interfere as the resurrection and judgment unfold. This reign perfects mankind and fulfills Jehovah’s Edenic promise, erasing death forever. Apostate Christianity, swayed by Augustine’s heaven focus (5th century C.E.), ignored this, while Constantine’s church (4th century C.E.) glorified war over peace. Babylon’s fall (587 B.C.E.) foreshadowed this cleansing, but Satan’s final test after the thousand years fails, proving Jehovah’s way superior.</p>

He lovingly made humans in His image (Genesis 1:27), justly judged Adam (Genesis 3:17-19), and wisely delayed destruction since Noah (Genesis 6). Satan painted Him as cruel in Eden, a lie Augustine’s predestination (5th century C.E.) reinforced, while Constantine’s Trinity (4th century C.E.) hid His warmth.

Satan’s lie—“You will be like God” (Genesis 3:5)—pushed rebellion, a delusion Augustine’s predestination (5th century C.E.) cemented, denying choice. Constantine’s church (4th century C.E.) forced faith, but Jehovah honors decisions—Israel’s idolatry (Judges 2:11) proves it—offering salvation to the obedient.</p>

            <p>Faith—complete trust in Jehovah—proves loyalty, as Abraham showed (Genesis 22:12). Satan tests it, as with Job (Job 1:11-12), while apostates like Arius (4th century C.E.) diluted it with debates, and Constantine’s councils (325 C.E.) replaced it with creeds. Pure worship demands faith in Jehovah and Jesus, proven by obedient works—neither alone suffices (James 2:26). Rome’s indulgences (1st century C.E.) sold salvation, and Luther’s “faith alone” (16th century C.E.) ignored deeds. Constantine’s church (4th century C.E.) replaced works with rituals, but Jehovah rewards unwavering faith and action with life.</p>
