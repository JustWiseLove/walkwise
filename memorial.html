                <summary>1. What is the Memorial, and why do you celebrate it?</summary>
                <p>The Memorial is an annual event where we commemorate the death of Jesus Christ, which he commanded his followers to observe. It’s not a celebration like a holiday but a solemn remembrance of his sacrifice, which provides the basis for our salvation. Jesus instituted it on the night before his death, saying, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Luke 22:19 - “Also, he took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying: ‘This means my body, which is to be given in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.’”</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 Corinthians 11:23-25 - “For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night on which he was going to be betrayed took a loaf, and after giving thanks, he broke it and said: ‘This means my body, which is in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.’ He did the same with the cup also...”</p>

                <summary>2. Why do you hold the Memorial only once a year?</summary>
                <p>We observe the Memorial once a year because it corresponds to the date of Jesus’ death, which occurred on Nisan 14 according to the Jewish calendar. This follows the pattern of the Passover, which Jesus’ death fulfilled, and it was an annual event for the Israelites. The Bible doesn’t instruct us to commemorate it more often.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Exodus 12:6, 14 - “You must keep it [the Passover lamb] until the 14th day of this month... This day will serve as a memorial for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to Jehovah throughout your generations.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 Corinthians 5:7 - “For, indeed, Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed.”</p>

                <summary>3. Who can partake of the bread and wine at the Memorial?</summary>
                <p>Only those who have the heavenly hope—those chosen by God to rule with Christ in heaven—partake of the bread and wine. Most of us are observers, not partakers, because we hope to live forever on a paradise earth. The Bible shows that the emblems are for those in the new covenant, which applies to the 144,000 who will reign with Jesus.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Luke 22:20 - “Also, he did the same with the cup after they had the evening meal, saying: ‘This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf.’”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 14:1, 3 - “Then I saw, and look! the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000... They are singing what seems to be a new song before the throne... and no one was able to master that song except the 144,000, who have been bought from the earth.”</p>

            <details>
                <summary>4. Why don’t all Jehovah’s Witnesses partake of the emblems?</summary>
                <p>Not all of us partake because the Bible shows two distinct hopes for faithful people: a heavenly hope for the 144,000 who rule with Christ, and an earthly hope for the majority who will live forever on earth. Only those with the heavenly calling, confirmed by God’s spirit, partake, while others respectfully observe.</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 10:16 - “And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those too I must bring in, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Psalm 37:29 - “The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.”</p>

                <summary>5. Why is Jesus’ death so important?</summary>
                <p>Jesus’ death is the greatest expression of God’s love because it provides the ransom that frees us from sin and death. Without his sacrifice, we’d have no hope of everlasting life, either in heaven or on earth. The Bible calls it a “propitiatory sacrifice” that reconciles us to God.</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 3:16 - “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 John 2:2 - “And he is a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins, yet not for ours only but also for the whole world’s.”</p>

                <summary>6. How do you know the exact date for the Memorial?</summary>
                <p>We calculate the date based on the Jewish lunar calendar, observing it on Nisan 14, the same day Jesus died. This aligns with the Passover, which Jesus fulfilled. We adjust it to our modern calendar each year to match that timing as closely as possible.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Luke 22:1 - “Now the Festival of the Unleavened Bread, which is called Passover, was getting near.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Matthew 26:2 - “You know that two days from now the Passover takes place, and the Son of man will be handed over to be executed on the stake.”</p>

                <summary>7. What happens at the Memorial?</summary>
                <p>At the Memorial, we gather together, sing songs, pray, and listen to a talk explaining the meaning of Jesus’ sacrifice. The bread and wine are passed among us, though only a few partake. It’s a simple, reverent occasion to reflect on what Jesus did for us.</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 Corinthians 11:23-25 - “For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night on which he was going to be betrayed took a loaf... He did the same with the cup also, after they had the evening meal...”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Hebrews 10:24-25 - “And let us consider one another so as to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking our meeting together, as some have the custom...”</p>

                <summary>8. Why don’t you celebrate Easter instead of the Memorial?</summary>
                <p>We don’t celebrate Easter because it mixes Jesus’ resurrection with pagan traditions, like eggs and rabbits, which aren’t in the Bible. Jesus told us to remember his death, not his resurrection, and the Memorial follows his command without adding man-made customs.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Luke 22:19 - “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">2 Timothy 4:4 - “And they will turn their ears away from the truth, whereas they will be turned aside to false stories.”</p>

                <summary>9. How does the Memorial affect our lives today?</summary>
                <p>The Memorial reminds us to live in a way that honors Jesus’ sacrifice. It motivates us to follow his example, show love, and tell others about the hope it provides—whether living forever on earth or ruling in heaven. It’s a call to action, not just a ritual.</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 Peter 2:21 - “In fact, to this course you were called, because even Christ suffered for you, leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Matthew 28:19-20 - “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations... teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.”</p>

                <p>Yes, everyone is welcome to attend! It’s a public event, and we invite all to come and learn about Jesus’ sacrifice. You don’t have to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses—just come with an open heart to see what the Bible teaches.</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 6:44 - “No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him, and I will resurrect him on the last day.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Revelation 22:17 - “And the spirit and the bride keep on saying, ‘Come!’ and let anyone hearing say, ‘Come!’ and let anyone thirsting come; let anyone who wishes take life’s water free.”</p>
